# TRAJECTORY — A Mission-Driven Precalculus Course

Trajectory is a six-unit, narrative-first Precalculus curriculum built as a static
site: pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, with Markdown mission briefs as
the content layer. No build step, no framework, no cloud account required.

Every unit reframes a standard Precalc topic as a mission with a real
engineering or scientific stake — students aren't "graphing transformations,"
they're calibrating a video-game camera rig; they aren't "finding asymptotes,"
they're certifying a rollercoaster for public safety.

## Why this architecture

| Constraint | Solution |
|---|---|
| 100% local-first, cloud-independent | No npm install, no bundler, no external API keys. Open `index.html` or serve with Python's stdlib. |
| No third-party account dependencies | No Google Workspace, Canvas LMS, or Notion API. Progress is stored in the browser via `localStorage` (student-owned, per-device). |
| Static repo, Git-native | Every file is plain text (HTML/CSS/JS/MD) and diffs cleanly. |
| Free hosting | Directory layout matches GitHub Pages' expectations exactly — push and it's live. |

## Run it locally

```bash
cd precalc-course
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

No other dependencies. Any static server works (`npx serve`, VS Code Live
Server, `php -S`) — Python's is called out because it ships with the OS on
every platform this course targets.

## Testing

The site itself has zero dependencies — `npm`/`node_modules` are only for an
optional dev-only test suite that isn't needed to run or deploy the course.

```bash
npm install   # dev-only: jsdom, for the test suite below
npm test
```

Tests load each unit's real `index.html` through jsdom and exercise it the
way a student would (drag sliders, click buttons), rather than duplicating
markup into hand-written fixtures that could drift from what ships. See
`tests/dom-harness.mjs` for the (small) set of jsdom stubs this requires.

## Version control

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Trajectory Precalculus course scaffold"
```

Recommended `.gitignore` is already included (editor/OS cruft only — there is
no build output to ignore, because there is no build step).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (free)

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Then in the GitHub repo: **Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from branch →
`main` / `/ (root)`**. The site will be live at
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/` within a minute or two.
Because `index.html` sits at the repo root and every internal link is
relative, no path rewriting is needed for the Pages subdirectory.

## Content model

Each unit folder is self-contained and follows the same three-file contract,
so adding **Unit 7** later means copying the pattern, not touching shared
code. `mission-brief.md` is pure content (editable by a teacher with no JS
knowledge); `lab.js` is pure interaction logic; `index.html` is the thin
shell that wires them together via `assets/js/graph-engine.js`.

See `docs/curriculum-blueprint.md` for the full pedagogy rationale, the
gamification economy (XP, badges, mastery gates), and the technical spec for
`graph-engine.js`.

## Development log

Running notes on what's shipped and what's next, so work continues
coherently across sessions without re-deriving context from scratch.

**Shipped**

- All six units have a functional lab matching their `mission-brief.md`.
- Unit 2 (Rollercoaster Engineering): added a Polynomial/Rational track
  mode toggle, a rational-track renderer (asymptote + hole), a feature
  checklist the student self-flags before running, and an animated
  "Run simulator" that rides the track and reacts to the first *unflagged*
  feature (crossing → no effect, kiss → bounce + fail, asymptote →
  fly off-screen + fail, hole → vanish/reappear + continue).
- Unit 5 (CGI Engine Vectors): fixed a matrix-composition bug where
  non-uniform scale (`sx != sy`) wasn't applied to the off-diagonal terms,
  which silently introduced shear instead of a clean rotate+scale.
- Unit 1 (Morphing Machines): removed dead no-op code in the base function.
- Test suite (`npm test`, node's built-in test runner + jsdom): loads
  every unit's real `index.html`, sweeps every slider, exercises
  check/new-target flows, and has targeted behavior tests for Unit 2's
  simulator and the Unit 5 matrix fix. Writing it caught two more real
  bugs: `graph-engine.js`'s grid-line loop stepped by a fixed 1 math
  unit regardless of axis range, which turned into a near-infinite loop
  for Unit 3's exponential y-range (now shares an adaptive step with the
  axis labels, which also fixes them not lining up); and Unit 2's
  checklist code called `CSS.escape()` for no real reason (swapped for a
  plain `Map` lookup).

**Known gaps / next up**

- Units 1, 3, 4, 5 award their "small" XP action (slider move / toggle /
  revolution / apply-transform) on the "new target" button click rather
  than on the specific action the mission brief names. Low priority —
  cosmetic vs. the mission-brief wording — but worth tightening for
  consistency with Unit 2's more literal flag-based XP.
- Units 3, 4, 6 are functionally complete against their briefs but haven't
  had a Unit-2-style "depth pass" (richer failure states, animated
  feedback, etc.) — candidates for future sessions if that kind of
  polish is wanted course-wide.
- `npm test` covers load-without-throwing + input-sweep for all six
  units, plus targeted behavior tests for Units 2 and 5. Units 1, 3, 4, 6
  only have the generic smoke coverage, not unit-specific assertions
  (e.g. Unit 3's threshold-crossing math, Unit 4's revolution tracking).
